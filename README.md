# Kavzors Web
I built Kavzors web because I wanted to share my in-progress projects as well as finished ones (as if you're ever done) or simply typical solutions I use for a range of different projects, such as the [MongoJ Repo](https://github.com/Kavzor/MongoJRepo) project I use for pretty much all MongoDB projects.

## Behind the scene
Kavzors web portfolio is hosted by [Github](https://github.com) whilst the backend is provided by [one.com](https://www.one.com/en/). The most interesting about this plain/typical portfolio is that it's actually backed up by a Java desktop application, meaning that all the topics are managed remotely and not by the HTML/JS. Pictures, lisecens, text, topics etc. all managed by a remote desktop application built in JavaFX. 

At the time I wrote this the desktop application looks like [Kavzors web desktop](kavzorswebdesktop.jpg)
